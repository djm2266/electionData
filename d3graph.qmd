# Interactive graphs

The interactive D3 visualization highlights the average support for Democratic and Republican parties across U.S. states from 1976 to 2020. Unlike static graphs, this interactive tool allows users to dynamically explore how additional or fewer states contribute to the overall trends in support for each party. By clicking the “Add bar” and “Remove bar” buttons, users can incrementally add or remove states in descending order of support, observing how the inclusion or exclusion of specific data points impacts the visualization.

1.	Explore Party Support: Begin by observing the initial top five states for each party’s average support displayed in the bar charts.
2.	Add Data Points: Click the “Add bar” button to include additional states in the chart, one at a time, in descending order of support. This allows you to gradually reveal how other states rank and their relative levels of support.
3.	Remove Data Points: Click the “Remove bar” button to reduce the number of states displayed, enabling a focused view on the highest-ranking states or to re-simplify the visualization.
