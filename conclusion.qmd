# Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis of election data across House, Senate, and Presidential races from 1976 to 2020 highlights critical insights into U.S. electoral dynamics. Key findings include the dominance of the two-party system, with Democrats and Republicans consistently controlling the majority of the vote across all election types. Presidential elections demonstrated the highest voter turnout and the most visible third-party influence, while Senate races showed the least variability in margins of victory. Swing state analysis identified battleground states such as Ohio and Florida, reaffirming their pivotal role in shaping national outcomes. Regional patterns in dominant party control revealed persistent partisan divides, with coastal and urban states favoring Democrats and rural, Southern states leaning Republican. Despite these insights, the study faced limitations, including the lack of detailed demographic data and third-party vote granularity. Future research could incorporate demographic and geographic analyses to better understand voter behavior and explore predictive modeling for swing state trends. This project underscored the importance of visualizing electoral data to uncover patterns, assess competitiveness, and identify opportunities for increased voter engagement.
