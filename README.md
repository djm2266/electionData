Description: 
We plan to do an in-depth analysis of U.S. election data, focusing on presidential, Senate, and House election results across all states, using comprehensive time series data spanning the period from 1976 to 2020. This study will enable us to examine more than four decades of electoral outcomes, allowing us to better understand the evolution and patterns of American political behavior and party dominance, discover correlations between different types of elections, as well as identify factors that influence electoral outcomes.
