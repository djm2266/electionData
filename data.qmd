# Data

## Description

Our project draws on several datasets hosted by the MIT Election Lab. 
Primary Source: https://electionlab.mit.edu/data

Data Sources:

1. Presidential Election Results (1976-2020)
Source:https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX
Description:
This dataset contains state-level presidential election results, including vote counts for major parties, minor parties, and independent candidates. It provides data on total votes cast, voter turnout, and percentage share of each candidate in every presidential election from 1976 to 2020.
Data Format:
CSV file with columns for state, year, candidate, party, vote count, percentage share, and total votes cast.
Frequency of Updates:
Static dataset last updated to include results through 2020.
Dimensions:
Rows represent individual state-election combinations, with thousands of records.
Planned Import:
Data will be imported into R Studio using the read.csv function. 

2. Senate Election Results (1976-2020)
Source:https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PEJ5QU
Description:
This dataset provides results for Senate elections, including candidate vote counts, party affiliations, and special elections. Data covers statewide elections and includes party-specific turnout information.
Data Format:
CSV file with columns for state, year, candidate, party, votes, percentage share, and whether the election was a regular or special election.
Frequency of Updates:
Static dataset last updated to include results through 2020.
Dimensions:
State-year combinations with additional rows for runoff elections.
Planned Import:
Data will be imported into R Studio using the read.csv function. 

3. House Election Results (1976-2022)
Source:https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IG0UN2
Description:
This dataset includes congressional district-level results for House elections, with details on candidates, vote counts, and party affiliations.
Data Format:
CSV file with columns for district, state, year, candidate, party, vote count, and total votes.
Frequency of Updates:
Static dataset last updated to include results through 2022.
Dimensions:
Rows represent congressional district-year combinations, totaling tens of thousands of records.
Planned Import:
Data will be imported into R Studio using the read.csv function. 

Issues/Problems:

Temporal Mismatch: The House election data extends through 2022, while presidential and Senate data only go up to 2020. To ensure consistency, we will analyze all datasets only up to 2020.
Runoff Election Data: Significant missing data exists for runoff elections, particularly in Senate and House results. This component will be excluded from the analysis to maintain data reliability.
Granularity: While presidential data is state-level, House data is district-level. This mismatch in granularity may limit the scope of comparative analyses. Aggregation or normalization may be necessary in some cases.
Data Quality: There are missing or incomplete fields in some years for minor-party candidates and inconsistencies in party naming conventions across datasets.
